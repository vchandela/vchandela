## Projects

- 🐝 **[Hive](https://github.com/vchandela/hive)** — A CLI-first retrieval engine with a self-improving feedback loop. Standard search metrics treat misleading results as harmless zeros — Hive uses UDCG, which scores them -1, then runs an LLM agent to detect the damage, fix the search config, and redeploy. Zero human intervention.

## Writing

**[Bits & Neurons](https://bitsnneurons.substack.com/)** — Book summaries, production-level optimizations, and paper highlights, with [Srijan Saket](https://github.com/srijansk).
